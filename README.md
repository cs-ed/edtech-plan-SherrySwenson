# Educational Technology Plan

The purpose of my educational technology plan is to design a diagram for a future introductory computer science course to be taught as an elective for **grade nine**. Currently, freshmen take an Integrated Technology / Career Education hybrid course.  The idea is that a new computer science course would be an elective course for those students interested in sampling or beginning a path toward a computer science pathway.

## Context

### Course

Course Description: Introduction to Computer Science for grade nine will be an elective course designed to develop computational thinking and build student excitement
about computing. In addition to learning about programming and algorithms, students build career awareness about
computing skills in all fields. Students also improve their knowledge and skill with regard to ethics, safety, and
security on the Internet.

### Situation

I teach at Paradise High School in Paradise, California.  Most of our town was destroyed in the Camp Fire on November 8, 2018. Along with the emotional scars, the population was also devastated financially. Families live in trailers on their empty home lots or reside in other means of sub-par housing.  Many do not have internet access or computers.  All work expectations will be for school hours on campus.

Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Google Classroom


Clever
The Clever browser extension is the key to making sure your SSO (Saved Passwords) applications work properly whether students are accessing Clever from school, home, or both.

CodeHS: Comprehensive Coding Platform for Middle School and High School
CodeHS is a comprehensive platform for helping schools teach computer science by providing web-based curriculum, teacher tools and resources, and professional development. With CodeHS, teachers have access all of the tools they need in one place, such as a customizable gradebook, progress tracking, and detailed lesson plans.

Aeries

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

### Application

The technology listed above is what the district currently has in stock and what is available in my classroom. Since this is a proposed class and not a currently functioning course, there is a possibly of obtaining other computers, in the future, if the need dictated it and if the district had the ability to make the purchase.  For now, I believe the chromebooks will be suitable for students to access beginning course materials.  I will be using accesssible websites and will not require specific machine requirements.  Some students may have computers at home, but many will not. Internet service has not been completely restored in an effective manner throughout town, so even if students have computers, internet service is not reliable.  For these reasons, the expectations are that all work can be done in class. 

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
