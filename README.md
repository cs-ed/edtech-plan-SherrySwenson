# Educational Technology Plan

The purpose of my educational technology plan is to design a diagram for a future introductory computer science course to be taught as an elective for grade nine. 

Provide a brief description of the purpose of your educational technology Plan

## Context

### Course

Course Description: Introduction to Computer Science for grade nine will be an elective course designed to develop computational thinking and build student excitement
about computing. In addition to learning about programming and algorithms, students build career awareness about
computing skills in all fields. Students also improve their knowledge and skill with regard to ethics, safety, and
security on the Internet.

### Situation

I teach at Paradise High School in Paradise, California.  Most of our town was destroyed in the Camp Fire on November 8, 2018. Along with the emotional scars, the population was also devastated financially. Families live in trailers on their empty home lots or reside in other means of sub-par housing.  Many do not have internet access or computers.  All work expectations will be for school hours on campus.

Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
