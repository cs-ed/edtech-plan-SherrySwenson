# Educational Technology Plan

The purpose of my educational technology plan is to design a diagram for a future introductory computer science course to be taught as an elective for grade nine. 

Provide a brief description of the purpose of your educational technology Plan

## Context

### Course

Course Description: Introduction to Computer Science for grade nine will be an elective course designed to develop computational thinking and build student excitement
about computing. In addition to learning about programming and algorithms, students build career awareness about
computing skills in all fields. Students also improve their knowledge and skill with regard to ethics, safety, and
security on the Internet.

### Situation

I teach at Paradise High School in Paradise, California.  Most of our town was destroyed in the Camp Fire on November 8, 2018. Along with the emotional scars, the population was also devastated financially. Families live in trailers on their empty home lots or reside in other means of sub-par housing.  Many do not have internet access or computers.  All work expectations will be for school hours on campus.

Provide relevant details about your course and/or school that will influence the
decisions in the plan. What assets and constraints do you face? What is the
context of your class, considering demographic and technical resources?

## Plan

### Software Specifications

Google Classroom


Clever
The Clever browser extension is the key to making sure your SSO (Saved Passwords) applications work properly whether students are accessing Clever from school, home, or both.

CodeHS: Comprehensive Coding Platform for Middle School and High School
CodeHS is a comprehensive platform for helping schools teach computer science by providing web-based curriculum, teacher tools and resources, and professional development. With CodeHS, teachers have access all of the tools they need in one place, such as a customizable gradebook, progress tracking, and detailed lesson plans.
