# Educational Technology Plan

The purpose of my educational technology plan is to design a diagram for a future **Introduction to Computer Science** course to be taught as an elective for *grade nine*. Currently, freshmen take an Integrated Technology / Career Education hybrid course that touches on the basics of technology.  The idea is that a new computer science course would be an elective course for those students interested in sampling or diving deeper into computer science.

## Context

### Course

Course Description: Introduction to Computer Science for grade nine will be an elective course designed to develop computational thinking and build student excitement
about computing. In addition to learning about programming and algorithms, students will build career awareness about
computing skills that can be applicable to various fields. Students will also improve their knowledge and skill with regard to ethics, safety, and
security on the Internet.

### Situation

I teach at Paradise High School in Paradise, California - located in Butte County. Most of our town was destroyed in the Camp Fire on November 8, 2018. Along with the emotional scars, the population was also devastated financially. Many families still live in trailers on their empty home lots or reside in other means of sub-par housing while rebuilding their homes or waiting to do so. Many do not have internet access or computers.  All work expectations for this course will be for school hours on campus.


## Plan

### Software Specifications

Google Classroom: Google Classroom is your all-in-one place for teaching and learning with an easy-to-use and secure tool that helps educators manage, measure, and enrich learning experiences.

Scratch: Scratch promotes computational thinking and problem solving skills; creative teaching and learning; self-expression and collaboration; and equity in computing.

Clever:
The Clever browser extension is the key to making sure your SSO (Saved Passwords) applications work properly whether students are accessing Clever from school, home, or both.

Clever supports the following operating systems and browsers:

Devices

- Microsoft Windows
- MacOS
- Chrome OS (Chromebooks)

Browsers: 

- Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Mozilla Firefox

CodeHS: CodeHS is a comprehensive platform for helping schools teach computer science by providing web-based curriculum, teacher tools and resources, and professional development. With CodeHS, teachers have access all of the tools they need in one place, such as a customizable gradebook, progress tracking, and detailed lesson plans.

Aeries: Aeries’ robust gradebook allows educators to spend more time teaching and less time doing paperwork.

### Application

The technology listed above is what the district currently has in stock and what is available in my classroom. Since this is a proposed class and not a currently functioning course, there is a possibly of obtaining other computers, in the future, if the need dictated it and if the district had the ability to make the purchase.  For now, I believe the chromebooks will be suitable for students to access beginning course materials.  I will be using accesssible websites and will not require specific machine requirements.  Some students may have computers at home, but many will not. Internet service has not been completely restored in an effective manner throughout town, so even if students have computers, internet service is not reliable.  For these reasons, the expectations are that all work can be done in class. 

It would be important, in a new computer science course, to generate interest from the outset.  While beginning with the basics of terminology, ethics, and safety, I would also incorporate short and engaging Scratch assignments.  Scratch will allow visual learners to have an immediate sense of what they are creating and provide a platform that is easy to troubleshoot.  The final section of the course will be conducted in Python as students begin to scaffold on the terminology and skills they've learned and built in the early sections of the course.

On the teacher end, clarity of instruction and sufficient modeling will be key from the start.  Most students will not have any background in computer science and even the terms used will be unfamiliar.  We will work through the initial projects step by step together.  Besides class instruction, I will provide video tutorials and fact sheets.  Feedback during the projects will be imperative so that students may recognize problems and edit along the way.  Class assignments will be listed on Google Classroom and grades will be transferred to Aeries.  Students and parents will have access to both of those platforms as well.

### Impacts

It is important that all students have the ability to learn in this course. When we were on distance learning, students were able to check out a Chromebook to use at home.  When we returned to campus, those Chromebooks were turned back into the district. Many students do not have a personal computer. For these reasons, I will be conducting all instruction, modeling, work time, and assessments within the class period on campus. If we were to go back on distance learning, the district would again check out Chromebooks for students to use at home.  In that scenario, class instruction would occur via scheduled Zoom sessions and assignments would be listed and linked on Google Classroom (as they would be for in-person instruction as well.)

Paradise has endured quite a few tough years.  After the fire in 2018, the community worked very hard to rally back.  Because of the widespread devastation, rebuilding was slow and many were still in temporary housing situations when Covid hit.  This added an additional financial blow to the town and its residents.  Still, houses are currently being built and the townspeople are resilient.  Our students deserve a computer science education that will give them the skills they need to survive and thrive as they move through high school, graduate, and move on to colleges and the work force.
